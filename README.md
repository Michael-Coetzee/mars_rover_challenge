# mars_rover_challenge
assumption 01: first input = grid size  
assumption 02: second input = position of n rover on grid  
assumption 03: third input = command given to rovers  
assumption 04: more than one rover can be deployed  
assumption 05: first input is hard coded  
assumption 06: even input will iterate between each rover deployed  
assumption 07: odd input will iterate between each instruction given to the rover  
assumption 08: rovers cannot exceed the grid size coordinates   
assumption 09: rovers need to take turns between commands, cannot run concurrently  
assumption 10: rovers cannot share the same coordinates after running command  
assumption 11: rovers cannot be deployed to the same coordinates
